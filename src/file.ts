// NOTES

// When you see FileOrPath, you can pass an open File, a file:// URL, or a file path or file:// URL as a string.
// If you are going to call the same function multiple times, passing a File directly
// rather then a string or URL representation is going to be more efficient.

// When you see FilePath, you can pass a file:// URL or a file path or file:// URL as a string.

// When you see ByteRange, you can specify start and end/length (or just one of them).
// If you don't specify a length or end for a ByteRange, you will get a 4 MB range.
// This is to prevent accidents that read huge files or consume all available memory
// and to avoid hitting the disk to read the file length if it's not necessary.

// When you see an optional Uint8Array parameter called buffer, you can pass your own array
// as an optimization or you can omit the argument and let the function create a buffer for you.
// If the buffer you supply is not large enough for its intended use, the function will create its own
// buffer anyway.
// If the return value of the function is a Uint8Array, the return value will be a view on the buffer
// you passed in unless otherwise documented.
// The returned Uint8Array that reuses the buffer will be the correct size for the valid data, but it will 
// be created using Uint8Array.subarray, so it will hold on to the entire buffer you passed in.
// Similarly if you omit the buffer argument, a buffer will be created internally that is sized based on 
// input arguments and then the final result will be a view on potentially a smaller part of the buffer.
//
// You can manage your buffers and views, check sizes, or release data using a combination of
// Uint8Array.buffer, Uint8Array.slice, and Uint8Array.subarray.

// Note that none of the functions in this file ask the file system for a file length
// separately from reading data. The functions are just designed to read the data and
// deal with whatever is there at the time.

// We use opaque files so there's one obvious way to do things.

// We're strict about terminating file paths and URLs that represent folders with a slash
// so you can test whether a file path represents a folder by looking for a terminal slash.

// FAQ

// Q1. Doesn't treating "file://"-prefixed strings as URLs get in the way of file system paths?
// A1. Hardly at all. Multiple slashes in a file system path are equivalent to a single slash, so if you have
// an oddly named directory, just use a path that contains only single slashes to get to it.

// Q2. Why don't the functions that take a buffer also take offsets within the buffer?
// A2. Parameters for offsets within a buffer are unecessary. All buffer parameters are typed as Uint8Array.
// It is easy to create another Uint8Array that captures the offset you'd like to use 
// by calling array.subarray(offset, ...).
// subarray creates a view without allocating a new buffer, so you can create a view
// on the existing buffer before calling the file functions.
// There's no need to add parameters for buffer offsets because Uint8Array already provides that feature.

// Q3. I don't see any synchronous version of these functions.
// A3. That's right. This library provides async-only functions.

// Q4. How do I read the entire content of a file?
// A4. If you know the upper bound for the size of the file, you can use readFile.
// If you don't have an upper bound on the size of the file, use readRanges.

// Q5. writeFile doesn't take a FileOrPath so you can't pass a File. What's up with that?
// A5. That's an inconsistency that we should address, but it is what it is right now. If you find it
// limiting, you can fall back to using Deno functions directly.

// Q6. Why does readFile with no arguments only read files that are strictly less than 4 MB?
// A6. Reading large files into memory without thinking about it is a pretty common cause of 
// performance issues. It's nice to be able to read a file with readFile(file), but not so nice
// that we allow reading files of any size that way. 4 MB is our limit.
// If you want to read a larger file, you can either call readFile with an explicitly sized buffer
// or you can call readRanges to read the file one chunk at a time.

// Q7. I've got a 4 MB file and readFile throws an exception. What's up with that?
// A7. readFile will throw an exception for any file 4 MB or above if you use the default buffer.

// Q8. Why is 4 MB the default size for readFile's default buffer (and for ranges where a
// length has not been provided)?
// A8. 5 minutes of thought and 20 years of experience went into deciding that 4MB is the right size.
// If you have a better suggestion and can show why it's better, let me know.
