// junction.ts provides a view of a file system that allows folders to be combined
// manually using .junction files, and automatically by associating items of the same name

// Junction files are text files where each line is a file:// URL pointing to a file or folder.
// Junction files use the `.junction` extension.

// A junction file containing a single file URL makes the junction file
// behave like that file, but with a new name or location.

// A junction file containing multiple folder URLs makes the junction file 
// behave like a folder whose contents are the contents of the specified folders
