// junction.ts provides a view of a file system that allows folders to be combined
// manually using .junction files, and automatically by associating items of the same name
// at the same level of the tree.

// Junction files are text files where each line is a file:// URL pointing to a file or folder.
// Junction files use the `.junction` extension.

// A junction file containing a single file URL makes the junction file
// behave like that file, but with a new name or location.

// A junction file containing multiple folder URLs makes the junction file 
// behave like a folder whose contents are the contents of the specified folders

// Imagine a file system like this:
// ROOT/
//  Images/
//      Image1.jpg
//      Extra/
//          Extra1.dat
//  Texts/
//      Text1.txt
//      Extra/
//          Extra2.dat

// We can get a view that looks like this:
// ROOT/
//  Image1.jpg
//  Text1.txt
//  Extra/
//      Extra1.dat
//      Extra2.dat

// by creating a junction that lists the Images/ and Texts/ folders.

// We can ask to combine the Images/ and Texts/ folders by creating the junction.
// Once we do that, the Images/Extra/ and Texts/Extra/ folders are combined automatically.
